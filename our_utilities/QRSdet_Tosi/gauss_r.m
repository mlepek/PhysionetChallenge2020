% 
%   Input:
%   ecg - raw ECG signal

    b1 = firls(n1,f,a);
    ecg_band = filtfilt(b1,1,ecg);
    
    % differentiation

	peak_candidates = ZCs;
    
    % sorry, poor removal of bad peak candidates 
    slope = ZC(ZCs+1) - ZC(ZCs);
    %peak_candidates(slope>-10e-15) = []; % 10e-15 - empirical parameter 
    peak_candidates(slope>mean(slope)/10e10) = []; % mean(slope)/10e10 - also empirical parameter, but less vulnerable to diffrent signals, as we think so 
    peak_candidates(diff(peak_candidates)<0.25*fs) = [];
    %peak_candidates(diff(peak_candidates)>1.5*fs) = [];
